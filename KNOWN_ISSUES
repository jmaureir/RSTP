18/08/2010  - then transmitting broadcast on the network and it is not fully converged, some loops
              are produced (when the topology have loops of course). to avoid this problem, make converge
              the network first (~ 14 seg) before to send broadcast packets.
            - timers are not disposed at the end of the simulation.
